Literally because twitlonger deleted my post and I need somewhere to put this for people to find it


Shit I've been wanting to say but haven't gotten around to putting words to "paper".

I feel like all introductions about me have been shallow and like "oh yeah I play video games on twitch" but I'd like this to be a more "hello, this is who I am and where I come from as a streamer and why I've setup parts of my stream the way I have". I generally encourage people to ask questions and whatever, but some of the topics I touch on here I will put a hard limit and say "this is what I'm willing to share please don't ask more." This post is rated "H" for heavy topics discussed, consider this a blanket content warning. 

You could call this a "coming out" post, but really I'm already out some people just may not know everything here. 

Basics intro, hello I'm HeroineDark/Heroine/Dark/Gennifer/Geni (you may use any name that you like, but generally I prefer Geni just because it is my name XD) I'm 31 years old (32 on Christmas day) and I'm a Disabled Autistic Intersex Trans Woman that currently lives in the greater Seattle area who plays Guild Wars 2 and other variety of games on twitch currently as a benefit to extralife (but that might be slightly changing) and drives shuttle buses for Microsoft corporate HQ. 

Lemme break that down into sections with a little more detail.

Disabled - yes the next words can infer into autism/depression/anxiety/dysphoria. But I also struggle with PTSD. I know I need to see a therapist about this, but with covid19 and personal issues, I can't open up in a meaningful and healing way unless I'm in an office.

Here's a small insight on my abuse that led to my PTSD: my biological family infantized me and conditioned me over the years...I didn't have my 1st working experience job (part time at Wal-Mart) until I was 25 years old. And after getting a job was told my the egg/sperm donors "we don't support you having a job while you're living with us. You can get a job after you move out." 

No joke, that was a conversation that i had 3 months before I escaped to Seattle from help of my best friend (we've been friends over 18 years now and a 1200 mile separation between us has been hard on our friendship, but he's part of the reason I picked up streaming is so we could relax and play games together).

Autistic - i was diagnosed on the spectrum when I was 7 years old. So much of my life was controlled by "oh you have this disability that's why you can't play outside with the other kids and sit in a room at lunch". I was on many different medications growing up and my head always felt like it was in a fog. When I got to college, I quit all my medications cold turkey and slowly the fog my head had been wrapped in all my life lifted. I started learning to socialize "like a normal person"...joining campus student councils and clubs was my crash course in learning how to act with people. (That's just over 10 years now)

I don't like to talk about this much because I don't like people to put my diagnosis before seeing me. 

Also this is in part to why I don't use a webcam...I'm awkward as fuck and having to "be normal" on stream doesn't work for me. So I use a chat cover and call it good. Also I may be silent for extended periods of time. This isn't to be rude, it is just a quirk of who I am. If you're into high energy streamers, you're in the wrong channel.

Intersex - yes I've been genetically tested. I hate the fuck talking about this. I am, but I won't talk about it.

Trans woman - who'd've guessed! I first knew I was "different" about 11 or 12 years old. First came out when I was in a private school at 16 years old. I was told "being trans is a porn induced fantasy" and for the next almost decade all my email/websites/internet activity were required to be disclosed upon request and I was denied all personal privacy...except what I could hide from them. I started hormones on October 11, 2012 because the LGBT center in Los Angeles was one of the very few "informed consent" clinics at the time. 

(Most doctors required you to see an endocrinologist who then required a letter from a therapist saying you could get hormones which then gave therapists the gate keeping abilities to say "oh I want you to lose weight" "oh I want you to try hormones based on your genetics 1st". And this kind of red tape still exists despite a lot of progress towards using the informed consent model.)

I finally got my bottom surgeries in November 2017. That has been the single happiest moment in my life apart from being free of my abusers. While I do still struggle with dysphoria and some body dysmorphia, I've done what I can for now to feel comfy in my own body. 

Sadly one of my my dysphoria/dysmorphia that has arisen from my bottom surgery is during my healing process

As for my voice… I have tried to "feminize my voice" but when recordings are played back...I may sound "more female" but when talking I sound more like a guy to myself….and when I sound more right to myself recordings have me at a deeper voice. At this point I talk how I'm going to talk and I believe you can take your opinions about my voice on a long walk off a short pier.

Why do I stream? Because I want to share my favorite games and discover new ones with friends. I activated the affiliate status to have channel points...I never expected so much support from subs and building a community. My only goal is to have fun and be welcoming to everyone as much as I can. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask, but I also reserve a right to not answer. 

Until next steam:

Stay hydrated
Make time for self care
And have a good day/night/sleep/whatever your time zone is.
